    <h1>Void Bot – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 29, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Void ("the Bot", "we", "our", or "us") collects, how we use it, and how we keep it safe. By using Void, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Void, we may collect and process certain Discord‑provided data in order to perform tag searches, server tag tracking, and usage-based enhancements. This may include:</p>

    <h3>User Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord usernames, IDs, and tags that are searched or tracked.</li>
        <li>Commands you issue to the Bot (including message content for command parsing and contextual replies).</li>
        <li>Presence/activity status of users (used for tracking tag usage in profiles).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Server IDs where Void is added.</li>
        <li>Server tags, metadata, and tag associations used for tracking.</li>
        <li>Server-specific vanity representations appearing in user profiles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Log Data (for debugging and moderation)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Timestamps of commands and interactions.</li>
        <li>Internal error or performance logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Track Message Content</h2>
    <p>Void uses limited message content tracking solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Parse slash and context commands (when applicable).</li>
        <li>Generate dynamic help embeds or contextual Bot responses.</li>
        <li>Ensure proper functionality of features like /taglist, /tagsearch, or when handling mentions of tracked tags within user input.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not read, store, or analyze private conversations or unrelated messages. Only messages directly interacting with the Bot are processed, and only the minimum necessary content is read to perform the function.</p>

    <h2>Why We Track Presence Information</h2>
    <p>Void uses presence and activity tracking to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify when a user is displaying server-specific tags, vanity URLs, or emojis in their profile.</li>
        <li>Track server representation in user statuses (e.g., when a user promotes your community).</li>
        <li>Support moderation or analytics features based on server presence trends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This allows Void to give accurate insight into how many users are actively promoting or representing your server at a given time.</p>

    <h2>Why We Track Primary Guild Changes</h2>
    <p>Void monitors primary guild changes from member update events in order to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect when a user removes or adds a server tag in their status.</li>
        <li>Automatically adjust tracking for server tag engagement (such as tracking how many users have the server tag "equipped").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This supports accurate tag usage metrics and community tracking across multiple servers.</p>

    <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>We only use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and improve the Bot's tag search, analytics, and tracking features.</li>
        <li>Detect when server vanity tags are being displayed in user statuses.</li>
        <li>Maintain stability, monitor abuse, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li>Comply with Discord's Developer Terms of Service and applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We Do Not:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.</li>
        <li>Collect passwords, private messages, or any non‑Discord data.</li>
        <li>Integrate with non-Discord platforms or third-party advertising services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>Data is stored only as long as necessary for Void to function properly and for maintenance or debugging purposes.</p>
    <p>We may occasionally retain anonymized or aggregated usage data (e.g., command usage frequency or tag popularity) for improving features.</p>
    <p>If you wish to have certain data (such as search logs or tracked tags) removed, please contact us via our support server or email.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data unless:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Required by law or legal process.</li>
        <li>Necessary to comply with Discord's policies.</li>
        <li>Needed to investigate abuse, security incidents, or spam.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect all collected data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure, limited-access databases.</li>
        <li>Regular auditing for unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Bug and error monitoring to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute protection, but we strive to follow best security practices.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Opt‑Out:</strong> You may stop using the Bot or remove it from your server at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Requests:</strong> You may request to review or delete any personal or server-related data associated with your usage of Void.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>Void operates through the Discord platform and adheres to Discord's Privacy Policy. We do not integrate with unrelated third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes will be posted in our support server or announced via Bot message. Continued use of the Bot after updates means you accept the revised terms.</p>
