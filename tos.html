    <h1>Void Bot – Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 24, 2025</div>

    <p>By using the Void Discord bot ("Void," "the Bot," "we," "our," or "us"), you agree to the following Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Bot.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Void is a tag‑search and tracking database integrated with Discord.<br>
    It allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search any Discord tag that the bot indexes or stores.</li>
        <li>Track and monitor tags in Discord servers where the bot is present.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Void does not replace Discord's own services and operates within the limits of the Discord API and applicable policies.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By inviting or using Void in a server or through direct interaction, you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm that you are at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required to use Discord in your region).</li>
        <li>Have permission to use Discord and to add or interact with bots in the server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not meet these requirements, you may not use the Bot.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>Void processes certain Discord data to provide its functions.<br>
    This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord usernames, IDs, and tags you search for.</li>
        <li>Server IDs, server tags, and relevant metadata.</li>
        <li>Logs of searches or tag changes for debugging or tracking purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Void does not collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passwords or private messages.</li>
        <li>Any content unrelated to its tag search and tracking features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data is used only to provide the Bot's services, improve functionality, and comply with Discord's Developer Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Void for any illegal purpose or in violation of Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.</li>
        <li>Abuse, spam, or overload the Bot with excessive requests.</li>
        <li>Attempt to exploit or modify the Bot, its database, or its features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to restrict or block users or servers that misuse Void.</p>

    <h2>Availability & Limitations</h2>
    <p>Void is provided "as is."<br>
    We do not guarantee:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous uptime or error‑free performance.</li>
        <li>Accuracy or completeness of search results.</li>
        <li>That tag data is always current or correct.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may modify or discontinue features at any time without notice.</p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are not liable for any damages, losses, or issues caused by using Void.</li>
        <li>Your use of the Bot is at your own risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Significant changes will be announced in our support server or through the Bot. Continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please reach out:<br>
    Support Server: <a href="#">Void</a><br>
    Contact Owner: Milo</p>

    <p>By using Void, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service.</p>
