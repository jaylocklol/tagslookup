    <h1>Void Bot – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 24, 2025</div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Void ("the Bot," "we," "our," or "us") collects, how we use it, and how we keep it safe. By using Void, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Void, we may collect and process certain Discord‑provided data in order to perform tag searches and server tag tracking. This may include:</p>
    
    <h3>User Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord usernames, IDs, and tags that are searched.</li>
        <li>Commands you issue to the Bot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Server IDs where Void is added.</li>
        <li>Server tags or metadata used for tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Log Data (for debugging and moderation)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Timestamps of commands.</li>
        <li>Internal error or performance logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>We only use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and improve the Bot's tag search and tracking features.</li>
        <li>Maintain stability, monitor abuse, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li>Comply with Discord's Developer Terms of Service and applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.</li>
        <li>Collect private messages, passwords, or non‑Discord data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>Data is stored only as long as necessary for the Bot to function and for maintenance/debugging purposes.</p>
    <p>We may occasionally keep anonymized or aggregated data for analytics (e.g., how often a command is used).</p>
    <p>If you wish to have certain data (such as search logs) removed, please contact us via our support server or email.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When required by law or legal process.</li>
        <li>To comply with Discord's policies.</li>
        <li>To maintain service integrity (e.g., investigating abuse or spam).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect collected data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Restricted database access.</li>
        <li>Regular monitoring for unauthorized access or abuse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>Opt‑Out:</strong> You can stop interacting with the Bot or remove it from your server at any time.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Requests:</strong> Contact us if you want to review or delete stored data associated with your account or server.</p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>Void operates through the Discord platform and follows Discord's Privacy Policy. We do not integrate with unrelated third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be announced in our support server or via Bot notifications. Continued use after updates means you accept the new terms.</p>
